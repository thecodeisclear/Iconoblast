Iconoblast
==========

All kinds of Icons made with Photoshop along with the original PSDs

Purpose
=======

A collection (growing, hopefully) of icons created with Adobe Photoshop. The original source (PSD file) is also included. Ideally, each icon would be in a separate PSD file, if not one icon set would be in one PSD. 

Organization
============

Icons are organized into different folders based on style. The primary reason for this being: ease of search and use. By going through icons in the folder "Flat", you can pick and choose icons that you want to use and they will be consistent (or can be edited to appear that way). The folder structure would be as below

- Home
|
+- 3D
|
+- Cartoon
|
+- Flat
|
+- Glyph
|
+- Handdrawn
|
+- Isometric
|
+- Outline
|
+- Photorealistic
|
+- Pixel
|
+- Smooth

Each folder will have two sub-folders: PNGs and PSDs. The former contains the preview of icons, while the latter contains the actual source files. If you browsing for an icon of choice, start with the PNG folder and if you see what you like, grab it or head over to the PSD folder and download the source. 

Guidelines to contributing
==========================
In order to group iconsets together, prefix them by the iconset name. Please don't use numbers, such as a prefix of "0001-". It is quite hard to track icons that have a numeric prefix. 

To-Do
=====
Here are the list of TO-DOs. Features that would be great, but haven't been implemented yet. Add to this list if you have an idea or (even better), take up one of these in your fork and contribute.

1/ Searchable table for the icons and tags associated with them.
2/ Some sort of preview (but then one could download the PNG and check it out, still a thumbnail feature wouldn't be bad)
